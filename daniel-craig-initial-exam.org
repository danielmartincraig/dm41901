We are at a point in history where the majority of Americans carry artificial
intelligences in their pockets every day. Despite this, computers are no closer
to rivaling the intelligence of humans than they were 100 years ago. How is it
that the field of computing can have fallen so short of its aspirations? It must
be that human thought is very different from computation, and that we actually
don't understand human thought well enough to mimic it with computers.

Human thought is a power that each of us is born with. It is unfortunate that we
are not also born with technical documentation detailing our complex and amazing
mental processes, which we take for granted. Our minds enable of us to have
original thoughts, make original decisions, to create, support, and collaborate,
and to be to be conscious of our own selves.
