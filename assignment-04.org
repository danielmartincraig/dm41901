    What is missing from this alternate definition?

    The difference between L_{eqc} and the language defined by this alternate
    definition is that \epsilon is not included by the language defined by the
    alternative definition.

*** DONE Question 2

*** DONE Question 1
    CLOSED: [2019-01-30 Wed 21:34]
    Design a DFA for L_{b3} , describing its design clearly in a few sentences.
    
    L_{b3} = { x : Every contiguous block of 3 bits in x must have exactly two 1's }

**** My Answer

     This is my original answer, followed by my updated answer. I realized dotObj_nfa(nfa_complement_of_blocks_of_three)

     the vacuously true strings were not accepted by my DFA, so I learned a
     little Dot  - he talks about them as if Jupyter were part of Jove.to make a better DFA. My dot code is derived from
     https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-dot.org.html

     My DFA is organized with its final states at the center. Each transition
     between states models the act of scanning across each of the contiguous
     blocks of 3 bits. As the block scrolls forward, it is possible to ignore
     any leading zeros. As an example of this, it is possible for S100 to lead
     to S0 when the next bit is 0. This is because if the next bit is a 0, then
     the block of three bits becomes 000 as the 1 scrolls off of the front of
     the block, and the leading zeros are disregarded.

*** DONE Question 2
    CLOSED: [2019-01-31 Thu 13:30]
    Now design a DFA for the complement of L_{b3}. Was this easier to design?
    Justify your answer briefly. (Note: Often, the complement of a condition is
    easier to specify.)

**** My Answer    

     The complement was easier to design, partly because I had already done the
     design for L_{b3}, but also I could just use two states, A and B, to filter
     out all strings shorter than 3 characters long.

*** DONE Question 3
    CLOSED: [2019-01-31 Thu 13:33]
    What is the approach to obtaining the desired DFA from the complement DFA?

    One approach could have been to simply draw the same DFA, and invert each
    node final/nonfinal-wise. I did something similar to this, but I went a step
    further by eliminating the seven final states associated with vacuously true
    strings, replacing them in the complement with two nonfinal states that
    exclude all vacuously false strings.

** DFA exp blowup, Page 63 [50%]
*** DONE Question 1
    CLOSED: [2019-02-01 Fri 21:42]
    Prove that the exponential blow-up is unavoidable for the DFA implementing
    the language “Nth last bit is a 1” (L_{Nthlast1}). This language is

    L_{Nthlast1} = {x1y : x \in {0,1}* \land y \in {0,1}^{(N-1)}}

    Here, we refer to N as the “look-back” of this language.

**** My Answer

     Exponential blow-up is totally inevitable because as N grows, not only do
     you need more states to accommodate the longer string, but you also must
     have additional states that make up all the branches that you didn't take N
     decisions ago.
     
*** TODO Question 2
    Follow the approach described on Page 61 and design a DFA that enters a
    final state exactly when the magnitude of the number seen so far (arriving
    LSB-first) is evenly divisible by 5.

    in this section for the ‘second-last is 1’ language.

**** My Answer
     L_{3rdlast1} = {x1y : x \in {0,1}* \land y \in {0,1}^{(N-3)}}

    For all the DFA you have been asked to design in this chapter, enter them
    using the markdown syntax of Jove. Then run them under Jove. See book for
    full instructions.
**** My Answer
     I did these in Dot code, so that they could be part of my Org mode
     document when I submit my portfolio to be graded.

** DFA Jove, union, intersection, Page 68 [0%]
*** TODO Question 1
    Take the DFA of Figure 4.7, calling it D. Obtain its complement, calling it
    Dc. Obtain the union of D and Dc without the pruneUnreach call. Print the
    resulting DFA. Is this still a DFA? (Hint: DFA are allowed to have
    disconnected states. However, these are annoying and many algorithms do not
    allow disconnected states; hence we prune unreachable states using the
    algorithm in Figure 6.3.)
**** My Answer

*** TODO Question 2
    Describe the algorithm implemented by pruneUnreach in Jove. Its code is in
    Figure 6.3.

** DFA, DeMorgan's Law, Page 79 [0%]
*** TODO Question 1
   Argue that if langeq-dfa(D1,D2) holds but iso-dfa(D1,D2) does not hold, then
   the bijection mentioned under the Myhill-Nerode theorem does not exist.
**** My Answer

*** TODO Question 2
    Attempt to directly design a DFA that accepts exactly the strings that
    contain an odd number of 1s and end in 0101. Proceed by trying to write a
    markdown description directly or draw the DFA on paper and convert it to a
    markdown.
**** My Answer

*** TODO Question 3
    Step through Figure 6.10 (call it DFA D) and make sure that the language is
    indeed the intersection of these two languages. Write down three positive
    examples handled by D and three negative ex- amples avoided by D. Now, using
    our tools, check for the existence of a negative string in D with respect to
    “ends in 0101” as follows: 
    • Obtain the complement of “ends in 0101”. 
    • Intersect with D and make sure that the intersection is empty. 
    • As extra practice, minimize this intersection; what must it emerge as (a specific
    kind of DFA; describe that in a sentence)?
**** My Answer

*** TODO Question 4
    Design a DFA for recognizing the language of all strings over \Sigma = {a , b}
    that contain an odd number of a ’s (call it D_{oa} ). Next obtain D_{eb} , a DFA
    that recognizes strings with an even number of b’s. From D_{oa} and D_{eb}, show
    how to obtain a DFA for D_{ea} ∪ D_{ob} using DeMorgan’s Law. Show all the steps
    using Jove.
